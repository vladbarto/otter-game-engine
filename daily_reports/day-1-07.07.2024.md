# Day 1 - 07.07.2024

I was able to setup the project from scratch in a visual studio environment. In order to run the code, I had to generate a `launch.json` and `tasks.json` specifically for VSCode. In `Tasks.json` the compiler terminal command shall be present.

It is important to note that every single `.cpp` file from the project has to be included and compiled, so that there are no Linker problems (i.e. no _undefined referece_).

I imported glfw library (by installing it with `sudo apt install libglfw3 libglfw3-dev` for Linux (Ubuntu-based ZorinOS) and downloaded GLAD library (you only need `glad.c` and `glad.h`).

Prior to all I decided the project's architecture. The best way to manage this project is an MVP pattern. So I prepared the folder-tree skeleton.
